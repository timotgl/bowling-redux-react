      <ul>
        <li>
          The minimum number of required players is two.
        </li>
        <li>
          A game consists of ten frames.
        </li>
        <li>
          Frames one through nine consist of two rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knocking down all ten pins in two rolls is called a <em>spare</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knocking down all ten pins with the first roll is called a <em>strike</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tenth and last frame ends after two rolls, if less than ten pins were knocked down.<br>
          A third bonus roll is granted to the player, if ten or more pins were knocked down (spare or strike).
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player's final score is the sum of all knocked down pins plus bonus points for spares and strikes.
        </li>
        <li>
          A spare scores the subsequent roll as bonus points.
        </li>
        <li>
          A strike scores the subsequent two rolls as bonus points.
        </li>
      </ul>
